<div class="entry-content"><p>Untold Entertainment recently released a new game, &#8221;<a href="http://www.untoldentertainment.com/games/sissy/">Sissy&#8217;s Magical Ponycorn Adventure</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.untoldentertainment.com/games/sissy/"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/sissys-magical-ponycorn-adventure-title.jpg" title="Sissy's Magical Ponycorn Adventure" ></a></p>

<p>Already the game has had some positive media attention, from interviews on both local radio and television, to several internet news sites including <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/good-news/toronto-five-old-cassie-creighton-video-game-takes-175342572.html">Yahoo news</a> and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/06/03/sissys-magic-ponycor.html">BoingBoing</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>After only having been released for soon two weeks (as of today, June 4, 2011) the game has received about 200,000 plays and $2,500 in donations (and more is likely to follow as time progresses).</p>

<h3>This game must be awesome!!</h3>

<p>Is the game deserving of all this media attention by being awesome and fantastic, with hours of intricate puzzles, stunning graphics, and gripping story lines? No.</p>

<p>Then why so much popularity? The graphics, sound effects (including most of the dialog), and story were all designed by a 5 year old, little girl.</p>

<p>Assume for a second that this game had been released on <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a> (which is, from what I hear, the #1 portal for Flash content with not enough quality to be allowed on portals with &#8220;higher standards&#8221;) and <a href="http://twitter.com/UntoldEnt">Ryan Creighton</a> (the father and lead developer) had proudly announced that he had produced the game all on his own.</p>

<p>Ryan could then sit back and expect a steady stream of classic Newgrounds comments such as &#8221;<em>OMGWTF gay</em>&#8221;, &#8221;<em>-9999/10</em>&#8221;, and &#8221;<em>giv me my 2mins of life bak</em>&#8221;.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Ponycorns&#8221; exploits the mentally ill</h3>

<p>At this point you are probably calling me an insensitive prick and have likely already started to flame me in the comments. But, I am trying to make a point here.</p>

<p>This game takes advantage of at least two &#8220;weaknesses&#8221; (couldn&#8217;t find a better word) of human nature.</p>

<h3>FW: FW: FW: FW: FW: Funny pictures (must see!)</h3>

<p>First, people love babies, young children, and kittens (for various reasons; you can likely dig up a lot of research on yourself). Anyone who doesn&#8217;t believe me apparently doesn&#8217;t have family members who have learned to use the &#8220;forward&#8221; button on their emails.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/seb_ly">Seb Lee-Delisle</a>&#8217;s iPhone app, <a href="http://kittenconveyorbelt.com/">Kitten Conveyorbelt</a>, is another game which takes advantage of this exploit ($1 for a slideshow of cats, seriously?)</p>

<p>Somewhat related, the &#8221;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/selling-8-beyblades-to-replace-destroyed-bathtub">8 Beyblades for sale on eBay</a>&#8221;, despite having several &#8220;fake bids&#8221;, still received a lot more bid amounts than selling the Beyblades on their own would have. Why? People feel sorry for these crying little children and their situation.</p>

<p>(Next time you try selling your car, include a picture of yourself next to it crying and see if it also works with grown-ups)</p>

<h3>Good job, sweetie. I&#8217;ll put this up on the fridge where everyone can see it</h3>

<p>Second, humans (at least the empathetical ones) will value items and achievements higher if they were produced when the &#8220;creator&#8221; was under certain limitations (in the case of Cassie Creighton, limitations in age and game development experience).</p>

<ul>
<li>Did your mother put your paintings of a giraffe with rockets strapped to it on the refrigerator because your work was comparable to Rembrandt?</li>
<li>And why would anyone otherwise care about &#8220;special olympics&#8221;?</li>
<li>And what makes Michael Phelps much more famous than all other swimmers?</li>
</ul>


<p>On a related note, even I can draw better than this elephant! Why don&#8217;t my YouTube videos get 6.5 million views?</p>

<h3>What can we learn from all this?</h3>

<p>Other than the obvious point of &#8220;Taking advantage of human psychological flaws leads to more attention and in return buckets of easy money&#8221;, there is a broader point to be made (which is by far no new idea):</p>

<blockquote><p>Presentation is key</p></blockquote>


<p>As I still haven&#8217;t produced even a single game, I feel like some sort of hypocrite (did I use that word correctly or is there a better term?) telling people how to design their games. After all, what do I know?</p>

<p>Luckily, the principle has many more applications. Often when presenting something, you are very limited, such as the title of a blog post, description of a game, or a small introduction in a conversation or speech.</p>

<p>Presenting any creation as &#8220;just another of many&#8221; will quickly cause the listener to loose interest. What makes your product unique? How does it stand out from the rest? (Note that I do not support lying or over-exaggerating in order to glorify what you are selling! Scumbags&#8230;)</p>

<p>Perhaps it will gain more attention if you release it for a good cause, such as <a href="http://www.triqui.com/2010/05/03/rebuild-chile/">donating all income from a game to earthquake/tsunami victims</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps even take advantage of a few other human psychological flaws, such as curiosity to reel in your listeners (this blog post title got you here, didn&#8217;t it?)</p>

<h3>Does Apple exploit the mentally ill?</h3>

<p>I simply cannot end a discussion on exploiting human psychology without bringing up Apple.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Apple sells a religion, not a product'>As I have said many times before (which someone said before me, but I don&#8217;t remember the source), <em>Apple sells a religion, not a product</em>. When you buy their iPhone, you buy an experience, and a ticket into the community of awesome people.</span></p>

<p>In a nutshell &#8221;<strike>Cigarettes</strike> Apple&#8217;s products make you look cool!&#8221;</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is Ryan Creighton exploiting our weaknesses for monetary gain?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s possible, but I doubt it. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/images/smilies/wink.gif" title=";)" ></p>

<p>This may be a good place to add that all donations and income from Mochi Ads are going directly to Cassie&#8217;s college fund (so help her education, and donate! Link is on the <a href="http://www.untoldentertainment.com/games/sissy/">game&#8217;s page</a>).</p>

<h3>Does this mean you hate the game?? And little children?!?</h3>

<p>Alas, I am neither a Vulcan nor a sociopath, and susceptible to the same flaws of human psychology as everyone else, so yes, I thought it was cute.</p>

<p>The one thing in specific I enjoyed were the small witty bits of dialog. They reminded a bit of the the comments found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemony_Snicket">Lemony Snicket</a>&#8217;s books (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/iqandreas/lemony-snicket-defines-denouement">sample excerpt</a>).</p>

<p>My favorite quotes from the game (spoiler alert)</p>

<blockquote><p>Your&#8217;e a mouse now. How do you like THEM apples?<br/>That&#8217;s what you get for being evil! AND a lemon!</p></blockquote>


<h3>Did you write this post to stir up conflict and flame wars, or perhaps to ride the wake of Ponycorn&#8217;s success?</h3>

<p>Neither, by writing this post I&#8217;m avoiding the PHP work on my plate, and since I&#8217;m still getting <em>something</em> done, I can avoid the feelings of guilt that come from procrastinating my <em>real</em> work.</p>
