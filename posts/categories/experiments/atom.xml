    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No, it&rsquo;s not painting with drops (though, that seems like a great idea for another project). Instead this experiment drops pieces of a painting down from above which eventually form to assemble a complete picture.</p>

<p>The code is written in AS3 and uses <a href="http://www.box2dflash.org/">Box2D</a> for the physics and <a href="http://www.minimalcomps.com/">MinimalComps</a> for the components.</p>

<p>At first I wrote the code up as a prototype just to test a concept (and rather than rewrite the code cleanly, I just kept adding onto it so it became one tightly-coupled mess).</p>

<p>I later entered it into a <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?362779-Information-and-Rules!">contest</a> held on the <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/">Kirupa Forums</a>, and modified it slightly to fit the contest theme.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/IQAndreas/Drop-Painter-Experiment">The source is available on GitHub</a> in case anyone is curious how it was achieved (and yes, I did cheat. It&rsquo;s not actually dynamic. The movement of all those shapes are &ldquo;pre-baked&rdquo; during the &ldquo;Loading&rdquo; screen and simply played back afterwards, which is why it is able to take up so little CPU on playback. <img class="smiley <a" src="href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/images/smilies/trout.gif">http://www.kirupa.com/forum/images/smilies/trout.gif</a>"></p>
