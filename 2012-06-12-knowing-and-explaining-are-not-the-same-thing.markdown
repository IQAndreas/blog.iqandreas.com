When I can, I like to help answer ActionScript questions on the Kirupa Forums. In my case, it seems to be a _"Those who can't do, teach"_ scenario, but I still would recommend trying it out to anyone who has at least a grasp of the basics of a language.




- **You learn A LOT** - Sometimes you know the answer to the problem off the top of your head, other times you have to download the FLA and mix with it yourself.

- **You can pick and choose your problems** - Picture a world where your boss hands you your work for the day; you look at the todo list, say "Meh, that's boring" and pick some other work you would prefer doing. When you answer questions on forums



- **The undying gratitude of the people you help** - It may sound corny, but it does wonders for your self-esteem. (And I have a free beer waiting for me if I'm ever in Sydney, Chicago, or the Phillipines.)
