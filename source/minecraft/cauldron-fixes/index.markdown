Cauldrons now work as magical 1x1 infinite water source blocks.

Fill an empty cauldron with water from a bucket. Once it is filled:

* You can fill empty buckets with water from the cauldron
* You can fill empty bottles with water from the cauldron
* You can empty buckets of water into the cauldron, giving you an empty bucket

The cauldron will never run out of water.
