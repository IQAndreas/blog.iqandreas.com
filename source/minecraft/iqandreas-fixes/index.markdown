A collection if my favorite fixes to MineCraft.

* Insta-break items (such as torches and redstone) don't damage tools.
* Using a lava bucket in a furnace does not consume the bucket.
* Endermen drop the blocks they are holding (such as grass and melons) when killed. This is a great way to get grass blocks without the Silk Touch enchantment.
* Pumpkins don't require a solid block beneath them when placed and can therefore be placed on ceilings and walls.

* The following recepies have become shapeless:
    - Flint and steel
    - Jack-o-lanterns
    - Sticky pistons
    - Storage minecarts
    - Powered minecarts
