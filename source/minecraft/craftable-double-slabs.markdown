Planning to build a massive structure out of double half-slab blocks? Tired of placing twice as many blocks to make the building?

With this patch, you can craft double half-slab blocks and use them to build with.

 * Double smoothstone slab blocks are made with two smoothstone slabs
 * Fireproof double wood slab blocks are made with two wood slabs

Made too many half-slabs? You can also convert some half-slabs back into full blocks

 * Two cobblestone slabs become one cobblestone block
 * Two stone brick slabs become one stone brick block
 * Two brick slabs become one brick block
