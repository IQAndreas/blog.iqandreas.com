This MineCraft patch allows you to once again harvest ice blocks. Ever wanted to build a castle out of ice? Now you can!

* Ice blocks can be harvested with the Silk Touch enchantment
* Ice blocks will randomly start to melt in the Nether
* If an ice block melts or is broken in the Nether, it will fizzle and disappear instead of turning to water (similar to emptying a water bucket in the Nether)
