The following are installable mods and patches for the award-winning sandbox game [MineCraft](http://www.minecraft.net/).

Unless otherwise indicated, all of the mods and patches are 100% compatible with each other.

### Patches ###
MineCraft is great, but it's not perfect. Pop these classes into your JAR to fix some common annoyances with MineCraft. Some of these fixes I genuinely feel should be in the vanilla game, others are made by request (even if I may not agree that they should be in the game for balance or other reasons). Pick and choose for your self which ones you like.

Patches are slightly different from mods. While mods may add new items or change game mechanics and objectives, a patch is meant to "fix" or "suppliment" MineCraft (but it's installed to the JAR just like standard "mods").
