This MineCraft patch allows you to adjust the anaglyph settings. 

_NEW: This patch is also available for snapshot 12w26a_, and will work on any multiplayer server by only modding the client (see "Download" section below for details).

You can change the anaglyph mode to one of these colors:

 - _RED/CYAN (Default)_
 - _Trioscopic (GREEN/MAGENTA)_
 - _ColorCode 3D (AMBER/DARK BLUE)_
 - _RED/GREEN_
 - _RED/BLUE_


For tweaking the anaglyph strength, there are two sliders available, both adjust different properties. Test around and see what works for you.
