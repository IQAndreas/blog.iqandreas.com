Patch that makes leaves more appealing to break yourself, rather than waiting for them to decay naturally.

 * Axes are more effective against leaf blocks
 * Axes no longer take double damage against leaves
 * The "fortune" enchantment increases the odds of a leaf block dropping saplings and apples
 * Destroying leaf blocks manually (rather than waiting for them to decay) doubles the odds of dropping saplings and apples
 * Destroying leaf blocks manually has a low chance of also dropping sticks
 * Plus a bonus easter egg involving gold axes...
