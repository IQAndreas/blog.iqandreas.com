### Download
As per request, there are two versions of this mod.

**No more Ghast Griefing!**
Fireballs from Ghasts no longer destroy blocks when they explode. They can still hurt you or other entities, and will still set flame to nearby flammable blocks (so as usual, don't build wood houses in the Nether!).
