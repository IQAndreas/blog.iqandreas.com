### [iqandreas.github.com](https://github.com/IQAndreas/iqandreas.github.com)
The source for [this very blog](http://iqandreas.github.com/)! (based upon [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which in turn runs off [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll))

### Description Utilities
ActionScript library which assists in parsing out all of a Class's members, or parsing out Flex metadata (both custom and native). Example projects can be found in the "downloads" of the corresponding repositories.

Includes the following repositories:

* [DescriptionCommon](https://github.com/IQAndreas/DescriptionCommon)
* [DescriptionParser](https://github.com/IQAndreas/DescriptionParser)
* [MetadataParser](https://github.com/IQAndreas/MetadataParser)
* [MinimalSettings](https://github.com/IQAndreas/MinimalSettings) _(still in progress)_

### [Flixel](https://github.com/IQAndreas/flixel)
My personal fork of AdamAtomic's ActionScript game framework, [Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel).

The repository includes both bug fixes as well as suggested changes or additions to the framework. The full list of branches can be found in the Flixel forum thread [IQAndreas Flixel branches on GitHub](http://forums.flixel.org/index.php/topic,5693.0.html).


## Small projects

### [FDT Ubuntu Launcher Files](https://github.com/IQAndreas/FDT-Ubuntu-Launcher-Files)
The source files required for the blog post [_Ubuntu: Adding FDT to the List of Applications_](http://iqandreas.github.com/actionscript/actionscript-in-ubuntu/ubuntu-adding-fdt-to-the-list-of-applications/).

### [Drop Painter](https://github.com/IQAndreas/Drop-Painter-Experiment)
Code for the "[drop painter](http://iqandreas.isbetterthanyou.org/public/kirupa.com/square-contest-2011/)" experiment powered by [Box2D](http://www.box2dflash.org/).

### [Disappearing Eclipse Project](http://iqandreas.github.com/Disappearing-Eclipse-Project/)
An example (and warning) of what happens if you forget to include the hidden project files to your commits.

### [Greenscreen Video Library](https://github.com/IQAndreas/GreenscreenVideoLib)
An easy to use wrapper for Quasimondo's greenscreen PixelBender filter, as well as some general video utilities. It's fully functional, but needs some tidying up.


## Bug fixes and patches

### [jekyll-static-comments](https://github.com/IQAndreas/jekyll-static-comments)
_Fork of [MPalmer's](http://theshed.hezmatt.org/) [Static Comments Plugin for Jekyll](https://github.com/mpalmer/jekyll-static-comments) (used by this blog)._ The recommended fix will automatically redirect the user back to the post they were viewing when they have submitted a comment to the PHP page.

### [gitignore](https://github.com/IQAndreas/gitignore)
_Fork of [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)._ The fix is applied to the `Actionscript.gitignore` and adds folders used by FDT which should ideally be ignored.

When in the world will GitHub pull in the changes so I can remove the damned repository from my profile??

### [FlxSnake](https://github.com/IQAndreas/FlxSnake)
_Fork of [PhotonStorm's](http://www.photonstorm.com/) sample Flixel game, [FlxSnake](https://github.com/photonstorm/FlxSnake)._ The only changes made were updating the code to work with [Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) version 2.55. (The sample game was made for Flixel 2.23 and is incompatible with the current version)


## In Progress

### [ErrorHandling](https://github.com/IQAndreas/ErrorHandling)
ActionScript library for making throwing and reporting errors easier.

### [FlxMinimalComps](https://github.com/IQAndreas/FlxMinimalComps)
An attempt to port [MinimalComps](http://www.minimalcomps.com/) to [Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel).

### [haxecast-sourcecode-fdt](https://github.com/IQAndreas/haxecast-sourcecode-fdt)
_Fork of [maxgronlund/haxecast-sourcecode](https://github.com/maxgronlund/haxecast-sourcecode)._ Identical to MaxGronlund's version but is set up as [FDT](http://fdt.powerflasher.com/) projects rather than TextMate projects.
