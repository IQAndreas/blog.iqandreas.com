Wait, putting your conditional procedures in a new block all the time is 'unusual'? If anything, I've rarely seen the obverse. Putting everything on one line makes the code unnecessarily dense, and breaking it up means you can see the structure of the logic from the 'texture' of the source itself, as it were.
