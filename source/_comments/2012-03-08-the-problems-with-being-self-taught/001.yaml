comment: '<p>I''ve been what you might consider a "developer" for just under a year. I taught myself quite a bit, but seeking out a teacher made a huge difference in my abilities. This wasn''t a formal classroom experience, but an internship with a Flash developer who was kind enough to take me under his wing for several months, one day a week. His help really helped me enter that intermediate phase (where I currently find myself stuck). If I could offer any advice, it would be to try and find a mentor: someone you can work with, in either a real or virtual environment, who can provide real-time feedback and impart essential skills.</p>

<p>I''m finding being self-taught has been a real hindrance in finding a job. Without formal education on my resum√© (or any major releases), my self-education has not been an appealing factor to potential employers.</p>

<p>I think within ourselves, being self taught is a sign of our determination, our moxie. It can reflect our drive to succeed despite a lack of background or prior instruction. Plus, it''s more economical than spending several thousands of dollars on formal education.</p>'
