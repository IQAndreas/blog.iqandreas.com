The [man pages for GIT](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/) aren't usually the clearest or most helpful, and is seldom the first place I turn to for help. Still, I ran across some valuable "best practices" information which I myself have not been following due to ignorance.<!-- more --> 

I thought the only place to mark which files to hide was inside of a `.gitignore` file, ideally placed at the root of the repository. As a result, I would list all files and folders I may want to ignore inside of it. [[1](https://github.com/FlixelCommunity/flixel/blob/dev/.gitignore)]

Instead, GIT has provided us with four places to provide [_file name patterns_](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html#_pattern_format), each with its own intended purpose _(some descriptions have been taken verbatim from the docs)_:

 * **Sent as command line arguments** _(Only supported by some commands)_ - Mostly only useful for scripts or "temporary exceptions".

 * **A .gitignore file in the project directory** - Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories via clone (i.e., files that _all_ developers will want to ignore)

 * **In the file .git/info/exclude** - Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user's workflow)

 * **In the configuration variable core.excludesfile** - Patterns which a user wants GIT to ignore in _all_ situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the userâ€™s editor of choice). Note that you can set the [global config value](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2114111/where-does-git-config-global-get-written-to), so every single project you work on will always ignore those pesky files such as `Thumbs.db`.


There are also further technical details in which ignores take precedence etc. in case anyone wants some heavier reading:
