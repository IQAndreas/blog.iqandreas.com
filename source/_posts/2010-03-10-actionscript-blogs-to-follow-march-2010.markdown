A Google search for "[ActionScript blog](http://www.google.com/search?&q=actionscript+blog)" returns over 5,790,000 results. In a widespread internet world like this, it can be difficult (especially for beginners) sifting through which information is reliable and helpful, and which simply isn't (hopefully this blog is not in the latter category).

Here is my personal list of blogs I find quite worthwhile to bookmark and check up on from time to time.<!-- more -->

### Freelance Flash Games ###

[http://freelanceflashgames.com/news/](http://freelanceflashgames.com/news/)

A great resource which stands out primarily for it's great articles about [sponsorships](http://freelanceflashgames.com/news/2009/03/26/understanding-sponsorship-licenses/), advertisements, game design, and where to find sounds, fonts, and graphics for your games.


### I help people make games - Michael James Williams ###

[http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/blog/](http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/blog/)

Several great tutorials and posts on making games, most notable for his guide on [creating an Avoider Game](http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/as3-avoider-game-tutorial-base/) in ActionScript 3, where no prior knowledge of programming required. One very helpful recent post is learning to [Blit and Cache MovieClips](http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/2010/02/28/blitting-movie-clips-flash-as3/).


### Emanuele Feronato - Italian geek and PROgrammer ###

[http://www.emanueleferonato.com/](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/)

Emanuele has several great tutorials on learning to make games, including using [Box2D](http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/) to create physics based games. Also a bountiful source of <strike>advertising</strike> reviews for a lot of commercial ActionScript software.


### gskinner.com - gBlog ###

[http://gskinner.com/blog/](http://gskinner.com/blog/)

From the guy most notable for the "[GTween](http://gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/)" tweening engine and the new, easy to use [Performance Tester](http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2009/04/as3_performance.html). New classes and utilities are released every so often, however, most posts are aimed more at intermediate ActionScript developers.


### Rasmus Wriedt Larsen ###

[http://gamedev.rasmuswriedtlarsen.com/](http://gamedev.rasmuswriedtlarsen.com/)

He doesn't have great amount of posts yet, and updates about as (ir)regularly as me, but the does have several helpful and easy to read articles, including how to use the undocumented function "addFrameScript" to add code to [run once a MovieClip has finished playing](http://gamedev.rasmuswriedtlarsen.com/2010/01/13/quicktip-execute-code-after-animaiton/) without the need of a timeline.


### gotoAndLearn() ###

[http://www.gotoandlearn.com/](http://www.gotoandlearn.com/)

A fantastic set of video tutorials on various categories, mostly made up of "introduction" and "getting started" videos for things like [Augmented Reality](http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play?id=105), [ByteArrays](http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play?id=120), ZendAMF, SWF Address, and more. It's not a blog per se, (Lee Brimelow does have a blog as well, but it's not always "beginner friendly") but it's definitely worth following, and a great source for beginners.
