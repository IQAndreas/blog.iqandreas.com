No, it's not a trap. There is no fine-print.

If you need any help with code but are working on a low budget, **I'm your man**. I also do tutoring, helping to explain anything you may have missed or still don't understand fully when learning a new programming language.<!-- more -->

### Why free? ###

We have all been in that situation. You need a small feature added or have a minor item that needs fixing in a programming language you either have never used or are still new to. You have two options.

1. Spend the next seven hours (or more) digging through Google trying to find something similar, and eventually hack and slash together something that _sort of_ works the way you want it to.

2. Hire a professional at $75 per hour to do the job.

{% pullquote %}I have been faced with these choices, and it saddens me that I nearly always choose option #1, wasting **hours** of my time {" when someone familiar with the language could have done it in 15 minutes "}. But if I hired a professional to help me out for every 15 minute job that blocked my path...{% endpullquote %}

### I can afford working free for 15 minutes ###

Although I reserve the right to decline any job, [contact me](/contact) if you need assistance with any of the following:

 * **Fixing/Tweaking existing code** - Do you want that menu on the left instead of the right and to expand when you click on it instead of hovering over it? I'll fix that.
 
 * **Debugging** - I love searching for and fixing bugs, I don't know why.
 
 * **Explaining code** - I [tend](http://iqandreas.github.com/actionscript/understanding-the-as3-event-system/part-1-the-basics/) [to](http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?334440-Video-scrubber-positioning-problems) [get](http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?275077-1203-No-default-constructor) [illustrative](http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?324256-1-class-to-multiple-library-assets-error-1203) when explaining concepts in programming. Some find this uneccessary, but for others (including myself) it makes concepts easier to understand. Though usually my explanations aren't _that_ long.

 * **Writing code** - I will only write code for small and sometimes medium sized projects. If you want to create a MMORPG from scratch and need a free coder, search elsewhere. But if you want a script to verify the user's email address when they submit a comment, perfect!
 

### Programming languages ###

I am _very_ comfortable with **ActionScript**, and have a firm grasp of the basics and syntax of **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**.

**I am not a designer.** I can only help with code, not making things look nice (which includes HTML and CSS).


I can be contacted via the form below, or via the media listed on the [contact](/contact) page.
