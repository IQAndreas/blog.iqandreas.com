comment: '<p>Nice guide, I loved the office metaphor. Great way to explain event listeners. The style is fun and it doesn''t feel like you''re just dumbing things down.</p>

<p>The code part in the "Creating the MouseEvent" section seems out of place to me, though. I don''t think it''s necessary to use AS3 pseudocode in order to explain how the MouseEvent is created internally. This is outside the scope of this first guide, considering that the next one actually deals with custom events.</p>

<p>Moreover, it might be confusing. At least if I was a newbie, I would think it''s somehow necessary to write that code and construct and dispatch the MouseEvent myself.</p>'
