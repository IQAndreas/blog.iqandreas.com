comment: '<p>Hi Andreas,</p>

<p>I know what you mean, I sometimes think I should have gone to university to learn programming. On the other hand however a lot of my friends who have degrees in computer science still call me when they''re stuck with code and all of them admit to being nowhere near as good as me as I learnt the things I needed, rather than what was on the curriculum.</p>

<p>The downside is of course that I have a very "hacky" approach to large projects. Instead of doing data-flow diagrams and organised project management, I tend to put everything in one large list and jump from task to task which makes it very hard to pass on projects that are in progress to other developers.</p>

<p>Like everything there''s an upside and a downside to it and you can''t really say one is better than the other. 
I personally think that self-taught programmers normally are better freelancers, as they usually are all-rounders and therefore have a wider array of skills, while uni-taught programmers function better in teams since they tend to be more organised and target driven.</p>'
