comment: '<p>A few thoughts.</p>

<p>1. I''ve known plenty of purely self-taught and plenty of college educated programmers. I wouldn''t say that the ratio of good to bad programmers was any higher in the college group.</p>

<p>2. Any programmer worth anything winds up being self-taught anyway. You can only learn so much in school. Then you''re done. Technology changes way too fast to rest on your degree for any more than a year.</p>

<p>3. I find a lot (not all) of college educated programmers seem to be complacent. They earned their degree, they keep up enough on stuff to do their jobs. Whereas self taught programmers often seem to hold on to that hunger to constantly learn more and improve their skills.</p>

<p>4. I think college is probably good for exposing you to a variety of languages and drilling in some real basics very solidly. But it''s no replacement for experience and a desire to continuously learn.</p>'
