I'm a self taught programmer too, started at the age of sixteen now I'm 24.

The problem with being your own teacher is that, if you're not a good teacher then you're not going to learn very well. A great example of this is the wanna-be hacker who goes out to the library to find books, only to read them without checking the publish date. Not knowing that he/she is learning is 2 years out of date. Yes I was one of those, but replace hacking with learning HTML.

Good teachers will not only teach you the fundamentals of a programming language, they'll also gear you with current technologies that are likely to land you with a job in the future. Again, something self-taughts can't do.

What I wish I did differently is go to University, and to also self-learn.
