comment: '<p>Nice post! I for one, being "self taught" kinda envy those who learned programming in a university. The fact there being more people, specially teachers / mentors, that can help you along the way on things like best practices etc gives you a heads up, sure the internet is great for tool for learning stuff but talking things over with others cant be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Like a lynda.com who you could talk to :)</p>'
